# arr-scripts-v2


## Support Info

Scripts are provided as-is... Generally, if a script works one time, it will work everytime, that is the nature of scripts... So if you're experiencing an issue that has not been previously reported and is more likely a technical problem of some sort, it is more than likely caused by user error...

Please note that use of arr-scripts is not supported by the Arr app's community. The scripts do not modify the software/code of the Arr app, all changes to the Arr app are implemented using publicly available API calls.
